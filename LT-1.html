        This is the first paragraph. It serves as an introduction to the page 
        content, showing how text is organized into readable blocks.

    <p>
        The second paragraph demonstrates how we can use <strong>Part C tags</strong> 
        to add meaning. For example, we use the strong tag for <strong>important text</strong>, 
        the em tag for <em>emphasized speech</em>, and the mark tag for 
        <mark>highlighted information</mark> that needs to stand out.
